# Helm Charts for Apache Drill

> [!NOTE]
> This project was originally forked from [Agirish/drill-helm-charts](https://github.com/Agirish/drill-helm-charts), but
> was moved to this repo for automated build and discoverability.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of files that can be used to deploy [Apache Drill](http://drill.apache.org/) on
Kubernetes using Helm Charts. Supports single-node
and [cluster](http://drill.apache.org/docs/installing-drill-in-distributed-mode/) modes.

#### What are Helm and Charts?

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager
for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). [Charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) are a packaging format in Helm
that can simplify deploying Kubernetes applications such as Drill Clusters.

## Pre-requisites

- A Kubernetes Cluster (this project is tested on a [K3s](https://k3s.io/) cluster)
- [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) version 3 or greater
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) version 1.16.0 or greater

## Chart Structure

Drill Helm charts are organized as a collection of files inside the `drill` directory. As Drill depends on Zookeeper for
cluster co-ordination, a zookeeper chart is inside the [dependencies'](drill/charts) directory. The Zookeeper chart
follows a similar structure as the Drill chart.

```
drill/   
  Chart.yaml    # A YAML file with information about the chart
  Chart.lock    # A YAML file containing information about the fetched dependencies
  values.yaml   # The default configuration values for this chart
  charts/       # A directory containing the ZK charts
  templates/    # A directory of templates, when combined with values, will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files
  docs/			# A directory containing files for the documentation
```

### Templates

Helm Charts contain `templates` which are used to generate Kubernetes manifest files. These are YAML-formatted resource
descriptions that Kubernetes can understand. These templates contain 'variables', values for which are picked up from
the `values.yaml` file.

Drill Helm Charts contain the following templates:

### Values

Helm Charts use `values.yaml` for providing default values to 'variables' used in the chart templates. These values may
be overridden either by editing the `values.yaml` file or during `helm install`. For example, such as the namespace,
number of drillbits and more to the `template` files

Please refer to the [values.yaml](drill/values.yaml) file for details on default values for Drill Helm Charts.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```shell
helm repo add wearefrank https://wearefrank.github.io/charts
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
wearefrank` to see the charts.

To install the ZaakBrug chart:

```shell
helm install zaakbrug wearefrank/zaakbrug
```

To uninstall the chart:

```shell
helm delete zaakbrug
```

#### Access Drill Web UI

There is a service that can be used, but this one will jump from pod, which isn't very unfriendly. This will be fixed in
the future. A ingress can be made to the service.

### Autoscaling Drill Clusters

The size of the Drill cluster (number of Drill Pod replicas / number of drill-bits) can not only be manually scaled up
or down as shown above, but can also be autoscaled to simplify cluster management. When enabled, with a higher CPU
utilization, more drill-bits are added automatically and as the cluster load goes down, so do the number of drill-bits
in the Drill Cluster. The drill-bits deemed
excessive [gracefully shut down](https://drill.apache.org/docs/stopping-drill/#gracefully-shutting-down-the-drill-process),
by going into quiescent mode to permit running queries to complete.

Enable autoscaling by editing the autoscale section in `drill/values.yaml` file.
